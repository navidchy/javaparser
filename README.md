# Java Parser

## Overview
This project is a parser for a simplified subset of the Java programming language, which checks the syntactic correctness of Java code and builds a parse tree if the code is correct, or throws an exception if it's not.

## Features
- Implements a deterministic parser for a subset of Java.
- Builds a parse tree representing the program.
- Handles lexical analysis of input strings.
- Throws exceptions for syntactic errors.
